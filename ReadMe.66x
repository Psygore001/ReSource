This is an attempt to improve the usability and fix bugs in ReSource 6.06.
You need the full ReSource package to use because only the main binary
of ReSource is currently changed and part of this package.

This new version is build from a resourced ReSource. This may introduce
bugs! Only a small part of the functionality has been tested. It is 
recommended that you make backups of existing .rs files before overwriting
them with this new version.

See Changes file for changes made.
