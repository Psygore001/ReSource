version 6.6.1 (2020-02-19) done by Wepl

* if screen height is greater than 512 pixel the height of the symbol and
  macro windows are enlarged to avoid scrolling in the list view gadgets
* no longer uses cmp2 instructions on 68060
* on saving an .rs file ReSource now remembers the used filepath in the 
  environment variable ReSourceLastFileName, when ReSource is later started
  without a file specification it uses the remembered filepath as default
  original file
* clash of two variables for saveRsOriginal fixed which caused Current to
  be displayed in the menu but Original was active
* the save path upon start has been changed from Current to Original for 
  saving .rs/.asm/executable
* disassembling of 'btst dn,#x' fixed for x > 7, no longer prints ???? in
  front of x
* some minor optimizations, some dead code/data removed
